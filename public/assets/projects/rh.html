  <p>my own logo is something i am constantly working on. right now, i am in a learning- and "experimentig with my style as a designer"-phase and my personal taste changes very quickly. therefor, i am always trying to redefine my logo to fit my current style. i always have been a fan of simple an clean designs. <br>
    in my first personal logo (pictures 3 to 5), i merged my initials into one glyph. It is easy to remember
    and appears professional and clean. The font used for the logo and the address card is Futura. <br>
    then, i redesigned my logo as i kind of got into the "brutalist" style that is even more reduced. my current logo displays my initials and an underscore. these initials were originally set in a monospaced slab font (courier new) but i altered the letters a little so that it fits better together. also, the underscore displays my current interest into everything digital and also web development. <br>
    nothing is set in stone so who knows, what i might come up with next.
