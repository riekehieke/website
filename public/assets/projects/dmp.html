  <p>the portfolio website for the university course "digital media production" at the university of applied sciences bremerhaven. the main use of this website is to show possible future students, what kind of projects are offered in this course. the web application displays work from students from all semesters and all branches within the course. apart from prospective students, this website can also be used by current students and also alumni to keep up with what other students are doing or to show their own work to friends and family.
    this portfolio website is built on the javascript-framework vue.js to acheive a flawless single-page-experience. right now, the structure and styling are done but the implementation of acutal content still needs to be done.
  <br>To check out the current website, click <a href="http://dmp-portfolio.jonaskuske.com" target="_blank">here</a>.
  <br>this project was a cooperation between <a href="http://maxmschneider.com" target="_blank">Max M. Schneider</a>,
  <a href="http://jonaskuske.com" target="_blank">Jonas Kuske</a> and me.
