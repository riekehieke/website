    <br> In my second semester, I got an introduction into filming. At the end of this course called "Audiovisuelle Medien" (audio-visual
    media), my team and I created the short film "TIME". It tells the story of workaholic James who couldn't care less about
    the people in his environment. One day, his time just freezes and he only has this one day to realize, what really matters
    in life in order to prevent a tragic event. <br>
  i took the role of director in this mini-production and developed the story together with my teammates. i also have a small appearance in the film (i play the bride).
    <br>My team consisted of: Jendrik Hauschildt, Torben Gamradt, Theresa Lehmann, Leo-Andres Hofmann and me.
