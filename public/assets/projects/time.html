    <br>Short film about a young man who couldn't care less about the people in his environment. One day, his time freezes and he only has this one day to realize what really matters in life in order to prevent a
    tragic event.
    <br> I acted as director and developed the story together with my teammates. The team consisted of: Jendrik Hauschildt, Torben Gamradt, Theresa Lehmann, Leo-Andres Hofmann and me.
