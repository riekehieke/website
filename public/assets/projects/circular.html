  <p>Circular, a typeface only constructed out of basic geometric forms (circle, triangle and square). The main focus was on creating an experimental typeface and describing a set of rules on which the typeface is built.
    Readability is unimportant as the aesthetic effect of the letters in different combinations is the crucial factor. The alphabet is presented on two posters and in an image clip which underline the playfullness but also the unity of the combined characters.
