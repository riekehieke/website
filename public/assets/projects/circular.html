  <p>In my second semester, I developed an alphabet called "Circular" based only on elementary geometric forms (such as circle, triangle and square).

    This
    alphabet, named Circular, was then presented in two different forms. <br>
    First, I created a poster to present my alphabet
    in a pleasing and attention-drawing way. It shows off the unique character and gives the impression, the letters float over the page. The colors help the alphabet to appear friendly and attractive.
    <br>
    The second poster
    I created was an informational poster. Here, the whole alphabet as well as the name are to be seen. Also, there is an informative
    text which explains the rules I created the alphabet by. This poster is held in black and white to underline its informative
    character and to improve readability. At the end of the semester, I also developed a short image clip for
    this alphabet. It was also my final project for the course "Typography and Layout".
