  <p>Marketing concept for a fictional app. The fictional app can scan any billboard, poster or text and tell the user which font was used. The marketing concept consists of a landing page various posters and an image clip.
    I created an app mockup, a billboard and roll-ups in a clean and minimalistic deisgn. This design mirrors the main design aspects that were also used for the landing page and speaks mainly to design enthusiasts and designers.
    The whole concept was a group project by <a href="http://jonaskuske.com" target="_blank">Jonas Kuske</a>,
    <a href="https://maxmschneider.com" target="_blank">Max M. Schneider</a>,
    <a href="http://conradschoen.com" target="_blank">Conrad Sch√∂n</a> and me.
