  <p>For my university-course "marketing", me and my fellow students had to create an imaginary product to set up a marketing
    report and create advertisements for this product. My team chose to "create" an app called "typro". Its main function
    is to scan fonts you see in your daily life with the use of the smartphones camera. The app is made for professional
    designers that are always looking for new typefaces to use in projects. Because of this target group, I decided to keep
    my designs simple and minimalistic. The logo was created by my fellow student Max M. Schneider and I created the banners,
    the billboard and also an app mock-up.
    <br> Also in my team were:
