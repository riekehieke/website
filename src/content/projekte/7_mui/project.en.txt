The workshop consisted of 4 five-hour sessions with about 20 participants and revolved around topics like ideation, wireframing, prototyping, design principles (Color, form and typography), accessibility and responsive design. As preparation and to accompany the participants during the workshops, we built a website with all the essential information.
