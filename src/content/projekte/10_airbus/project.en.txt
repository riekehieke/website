Text: [{"content":{"text":"<p>During my studies, I took part in a project in collaboration with Airbus Bremen. The task was to develop solutions to present the accomplishments and potential of Airbus Bremen. Early on, the idea was born to build a campaign, that smoothly combines a digital experience with print products. This idea turned into the \"AR-Campaign\". This campaign with the motto \"Bremen bringt's\" (eng.: Bremen is bringing it) tells a brand story, that guides the users along the 4 steps into space: the Airbus A350, the Ariane rocket, the ISS and the spaceship Orion. This modular concept is expandable by endless further steps. For each step, we designed a custom animation as well as an AR-poster. Once the user scans the poster, the animation plays and the poster thus comes to life in augmented reality. After the animation, the user is directed towards a website, which we developed, that combines all the steps into one interactive experience. This creates a crossmedia experience lifecycle with touchpoints in print, in the digital world and in real life with the option to visit Airbus Bremen.<\/p>"},"id":"a6e4c992-1e48-4cd0-9dbb-a6a3a5df7922","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"text":"<p>This project was created in collaboration with Max M.
