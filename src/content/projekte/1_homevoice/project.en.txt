Text: [{"content":{"text":"<p>For almost two years, I worked for homevoice as an interaction designer. homevoice is a B2B-software for property management companys, that supports the employees in and eases their daily work. As opposed to the established systems in the field, the users don't have to navigate countless confusing input masks. Instead, their tasks are being organized in clear to-dos. In these to-dos, the users are being guided through carefully thought-through workflows. homevoice also stands out because of its easy and clear user guidance. This is how the software simplifies the daily work of property managers to give them the time to concentrate on what really matters: their clients.<\/p>"},"id":"f99da63d-cf74-4aed-aaa6-e4e5622009d4","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"text":"<p>In my work as interaction designer, I mainly ideated and designed new functionalities and workflows as well as the corresponding user interfaces.
