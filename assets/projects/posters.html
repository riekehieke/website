  <p>Here, you can look at posters that I created for various reasons. Just now, the collection is not really big but I will
    update this project with any new poster I create.
    <br>
    <br> 1st poster: study project I did as a final work in the first semester. It illustrates the number of marriages and divorces
    in Germany from 1990 until 2015.
    <br>
    <br> 2nd poster (draft): advertisement for the annual presentation day of my study course in Bremerhaven, Germany.
