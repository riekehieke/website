  <p>The departement of climate change of my university was looking for a new logo and thus created a competition amongst the
    students. I participated and created this logo. The logo can be interpreted as two hands holding the earth but also as
    an eye or waves. This demonstrates the main focus of climate change activists: protect the earth and keep an eye on everything.
    The waves, as well as the colors, reference the location of the university: directly at the shore of the north sea. <br>
    The final outcome is a sleek, modern yet recognizable logo with a cleraly visible connection to the north sea and the subject climate change.
