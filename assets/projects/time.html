    <br> In my second semester, I got an introduction into filming. At the end of this course called "Audiovisuelle Medien" (audio-visual
    media), my team and I created the short film "TIME". It tells the story of workaholic James who couldn't care less about
    the people in his environment. One day, his time just freezes and he only has this one day to realize, what really matters
    in life and to prevent a tragic event.
    <br>My team consisted of: Jendrik Hauschildt, Torben Gamradt, Theresa Lehmann, Leo-Andres Hofmann and me.
