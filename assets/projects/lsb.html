  <p>A project that i was really looking forward to was to create the corporate design of the landessportbund bremen. the landessportbund bremen is the biggest sport-organization in bremen with aproximatly 160.000 members. <br>
    this project was a half-fictiv universtity project. the educational character was still the most important part in this project but nevertheless, we had direct contact with the customer in the form of interviews and focus groups.
    the customer, the landessportbund bremen, really needed a new corporate design. Our task was, to create a corporate deisng from scratch with fokus on a new logo and then present this new corporate design in an appealing and suiting corporate design manual. <br>
even though we mainly crated these corporate design manuals for educational purposes, the customer still has the option to choose one and hire the student to integrate his corporate design.
<br>
<br>
My logo consists of a modern geometric form with a cut-out area and sleek tyogrpahy. the main goal was to build a bridge between the organizational character and the need to be represented in politics as well as the wish to display sport, fun, agility and integrity. <br>
to fresh up the modern and sleek design, i used bright colors. the logo has another extraordinary feature: it is actually a modular system. the main logo can be enhanced by a second module to visualize which departement of this rather big organization is speaking. <br>
the corporate design references the logo design visibly. the format is the same as the geometric form of the logo and there also is a cut-out zone, which is used to *binden* the pages. the headlines of each page are also underlayed with the same colors defined in the corporate design. <br>
<br>
