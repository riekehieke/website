  <p>In my second semester, I developed an alphabet based on only elementary forms (such as circle, triangle and square). This
    alphabet, named Circular, was then presented in two different forms. First, I created a poster to present my alphabet
    in a pleasing and attention-drawing way. The colors help the alphabet to appear friendly and attractive. The second poster
    I created was an information poster. Here, the whole alphabet as well as the name are to be seen. Also, there is an informative
    text which explains the rules I created the alphabet by. This poster is held in black and white to underline its informative
    character and to improve the readability. At the end of the second semester, I also developed a short image clip for
    this font. It was also my final project for the course "Typography and Layout".
