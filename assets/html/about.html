  <h1>about</h1>
  <p>Hi, my name is Rieke Helmers. I'm a 20 year old digital media production student in the third semester currently based
    in Bremerhaven, Germany. My studies in Bremerhaven include 3D-animation, programming, filming, typography and graphic/corporate
    design. In summer 2017, I started to specialize in the field of graphic/corporate design and typography. On this website,
    you can get a first impression of me and my work.
    <br>If you have any questions, feel free to
    <a href="#" id="goto_contact">contact</a> me!</p>
